# BleachBit wishlist

For any wishlist enhancements related to BleachhBit, file them in this repository as an issue. To make it more manageable, submit one wishlist item per issue. If the enhancement can implemented in pieces, it may be worthwhile to separate it into separate issues.

What is a wishlist? It is not a bug, and it is not critical. It could be nice to have, or it could be a great idea. A wishlist will not be implemented right away. When it will be implemented in the near future, the wishlist is promoted to an enhancement, and it can be moved to the main repository.

Wishlists are a separate repository to make it easier to manage issues, such as bugs, in the other repositories.

This repository is intended not to have any code.
